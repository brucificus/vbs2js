		<li>I never anticipated this would get so popular.</li>
		<li>You probably don't want to bother with it.</li>

	<p>ScriptConverter started as a shortcut for work I often did in 2002-2004.&nbsp;
	I was surprised when a few folks expressed interest in making it a community project, which was exciting, but it didn't go far.&nbsp;
	As a result, it looked exciting(!), but is little more than a prototype.&nbsp;
	One roadblock is that VBScript has many convenience functions built-in (e.g. for <a href="../jsDate/jsDate.html" title="jsDate - VBScript and VB6 native Date functions emulated in Javascript">Dates</a>), which <a href="http://blog.throbs.net/2005/06/13/Javascript+Vs+VBScript++Pros+And+Cons+Compared.aspx" title="Javascript -vs- VBScript, pros and cons compared">Javascript does not</a>.&nbsp;
	</p>

	<p>
	I'm glad to know that many have found and benefitted from it.&nbsp;
	To those it's helped, you're welcome!&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p>
	I think a lot of script beginners have found it too, and were disappointed when their copy/pasted samples didn't run as-is.&nbsp;
	To those it's frustrated, my apologies.&nbsp;
	Sadly, VBScript is pretty much dead and gone (thanks to web standards, Classic ASP &rarr; ASP.net, and WSH &rarr; Powershell), and these days what you want is probably already written better in Javascript somewhere.&nbsp;

<h3>What it is:</h3>
<p>ScriptConverter performs a basic translation of VBScript code into Javascript code.&nbsp;
It uses Regular Expressions in Javascript to detect the language constructs and map them to the equivalent in Javascript.
</p>

<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>Have you ever inherited a web-project coded with client-side VBScript which had to be upgraded to work in other browsers?
Or a project which was coded in a mish-mash of JS & VBS, and which you need to make consistent?&nbsp;
I've had to do both way too many times.&nbsp;
Manually converting is a huge pain, and prone to create syntax mistakes.&nbsp;
After doing the same syntax conversions and thinking for the <i>n</i>th time that a computer should be doing this, I decided it would.&nbsp;
Thus, the ScriptConverter tool was conceived, and way too many hours of painful regular expressions creation
were invested to bring it into the world.
</p>

<h3>How to use it:</h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Paste in your VBScript (clear the original sample VBScript first).</li>
		<li>Click the Convert button.</li>
		<li>Copy out your Javascript.</li>
		<li>Paste into your editor, and review for any remaining translation work.</li>
	</ol>
</p>


<h3>limitations</h3>
<p>ScriptConverter does not perform a complete translation.&nbsp;
It converts the basic & most-used language constructs -- the first 90% or so of the work.&nbsp;
The remaining 10% you will simply have to convert yourself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>ScriptConverter has only been tested in IE6.&nbsp; It may not work correctly in other web browsers.</p>

<h3>participation</h3>
<p>If you want to contribute regular expressions for constructs which aren't covered
(or are better than existing ones), they're certainly welcome.&nbsp;
I'd love to open this up to be a community project.&nbsp;
</p>
<!--<p>OR, if you find this incredibly useful, and want to contribute financially, ...</p>-->
